# mrkdown

mrkdown is an android app to create Tumblr posts with Markdown.

## Motivation

I have become frustrated with the official [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) iOS 
app's difficulties with creating a text post with formatting (italics, 
bold text, etc.). Therefore, I'm creating an app to allow you to write a Tumblr 
post in Markdown.

## Goals

* [ ] Preview functionality
  * [ ] Headings
  * [ ] Formatted text
  * [ ] Links
  * [ ] Images
* [ ] Ability to add media (images, etc.) to posts
* [ ] Queue and schedule functionality
* [ ] Works with reblogs
  * [ ] Possible share extension from the Tumblr app
* [ ] Syntax highlighting in editor view
* [ ] Report bugs in-app that open GitHub issues
* [ ] Tablet layout
