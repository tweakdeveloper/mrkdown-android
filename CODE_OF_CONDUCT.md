# mrkdown Code of Conduct

While mrkdown is (at the moment) a personal project, I recognize that any
future contributors will come from a background that likely differs
significantly from mine. This leads to the following declaration to ensure that
all future contributors are treated with respect:

mrkdown will work within the terms of the
[Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
Contributors are expected to comply with the guidelines, except that as this is
not a Mozilla project, the reporting process will differ.

## Reporting

Violations can be reported using a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/tweakdeveloper/mrkdown-android/issues/new/choose).
Please use the "Code of Conduct Violation Report" to create a report.
