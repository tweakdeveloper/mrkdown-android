# Reporting Security Issues

I take security bugs in mrkdown very seriously. I appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/tweakdeveloper/mrkdown-android/security/advisories/new)
tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After
the initial reply to your report, I'll keep you informed of the progress
towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or
guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Attribution

This security policy is based (almost entirely) on
[Electron's](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/SECURITY.md). I
can't thank them enough for simplifying the language needed to the point that
even I could understand it.
