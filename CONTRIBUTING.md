# Contributing to mrkdown

The following guidelines will help ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Community Expectations

Please be polite to each other, even in a disagreement. More details can be
found in the [mrkdown Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Creating Issues

When possible, use one of the GitHub issue templates. Try to include as much of
the information requested as possible. As much as I try, when certain
information is missing, it makes it much harder or even impossible to reproduce
any bugs or other issues you may be encountering.

## Creating Pull Requests

### Code Style

I like two-space indents using spaces, not tabs.

### Compatibility

The current `minSdk` is 24, Android 7.0 Nougat.

### Licensing

This is an open-source project. By contributing code, it will be licensed under
the terms of [the MIT license](LICENSE).
